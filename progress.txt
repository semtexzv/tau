# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Project scaffolding and dependencies
- What was done: Initialized Cargo lib project, set up all dependencies (crossterm with event-stream, unicode-width, unicode-segmentation, tokio, futures), created module structure with placeholder comments.
- Files changed: Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs, src/terminal.rs, src/utils.rs, src/component.rs, src/tui.rs, src/components/mod.rs
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - crossterm 0.28.1 resolved (0.29.0 available but PRD specifies 0.28)
  - unicode-segmentation resolved to 1.12.0 (compatible with specified 1.11)
  - All 56 dependency packages lock cleanly
  - cargo check and cargo test both pass with zero warnings
## Task self-review PASSED

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Terminal trait and CrosstermTerminal
- What was done: Implemented Terminal trait with 7 methods (start, stop, write, flush, size, hide_cursor, show_cursor), CrosstermTerminal using crossterm, and MockTerminal capturing writes to Vec<String>. Wrote 9 tests covering construction, writes, start/stop, cursor visibility, size, flush, and object safety.
- Files changed: src/terminal.rs, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Terminal trait is object-safe — can use `Box<dyn Terminal>` (verified with test)
  - MockTerminal has public fields (writes, started, stopped, cursor_visible) for direct test assertions
  - MockTerminal.output() concatenates all writes for full output inspection
  - MockTerminal.set_size() allows simulating resize in tests
  - crossterm::terminal::size() may fail in test/CI environments — fallback to (80, 24)
  - Event reading is NOT on the trait — crossterm's EventStream used directly by TUI run loop
## Task self-review PASSED
