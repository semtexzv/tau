## Iteration 1 - US-001: Project scaffolding and dependencies
- What was done: Initialized Cargo lib project, set up all dependencies (crossterm with event-stream, unicode-width, unicode-segmentation, tokio, futures), created module structure with placeholder comments.
- Files changed: Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs, src/terminal.rs, src/utils.rs, src/component.rs, src/tui.rs, src/components/mod.rs
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - crossterm 0.28.1 resolved (0.29.0 available but PRD specifies 0.28)
  - unicode-segmentation resolved to 1.12.0 (compatible with specified 1.11)
  - All 56 dependency packages lock cleanly
  - cargo check and cargo test both pass with zero warnings
## Task self-review PASSED
